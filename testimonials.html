"This project has made me think about being patient and working with my problems instead of against them."<br/>
<span class="name">Kat, Grade 8 (1998) Boxes</span>
<br/><br/>

"Some things succeeded and others didn't. Sometimes not succeeding makes a whole new idea."<br/>
<span class="name">Christina, Grade 8 (1998) Boxes</span>
<br/><br/>

"I will always wonder how it happened that I made this box. Mystery of how I got the idea at all. Wonder at 
how it all worked and pleasure that it did."<br/>
<span class="name">Helen, Grade 6 (1998) Boxes</span>
<br/><br/>

"It was scary. I felt responsible because my box would represent my culture and myself. It made me respect, 
in a very serious way, my culture and my roots."<br />
<span class="name">Irina, Grade 11 (2001) The Culture Box</span>
<br/><br/>

"When I was making the culture box, I went through many different ideas. I tried to think in terms of what 
everyone must go by and what makes us what we are mentally. Not only does our exterior culture do it, but 
also our inner one, our emotions. The exterior culture is different for everyone. It varies wherever you go. 
But our emotions are something none of us can escape."<br/>
<span class="name">Anna, Grade 12 (2001) The Culture Box</span>
<br/><br/>

"I really had some strong emotions all through the process. They helped and guided me through the path. I 
feel it's best to live and grow up in a single culture. Sure, if you live in different cultures, different 
ways, ideas and traditions may inspire you. But somewhere along the line you may lose your cultural identity. 
It's hard to live between two cultures. When in one, you long for the other."<br/>
<span class="name">Anastasia, Grade 12 (2001) The Culture Box</span>
<br/><br/>

"Sometimes things go right when you are sure they are wrong. This is the funny thing about art. Every time 
I was struggling with something, I got it right either by making a mistake or not focusing too much on what 
I was doing. These kinds of experiences make me believe that art can be played around with and that it is 
never a one-way deal. You can never be sure where it is taking you and what the final results are going to be. "<br/>
<span class="name">Despina, Grade 12 (2001) The Culture Box</span>
<br/><br/>

"I feel proud of the work I've done. Even if it was not always good or successful, I worked hard. Before this 
course, I only knew how to paint and draw. Now I know how to imagine."<br/>
<span class="name">Tomomi, Grade 11 (2002) Magic Boxes</span>
<br/><br/>

"I learned the skill of understanding how the mind works and of being able to trace the connections. The outcome 
is always original because each mind is different."<br/>
<span class="name">Marko, Grade 12 (2002) Magic Boxes</span>
<br/><br/>

"This led to my thinking how everything is connected and how everything is able to flow into one another. I 
learned that boxes don't necessarily need an inside, an outside, or walls or even a function. Art is limitless."<br/>
<span class="name">Teddie, Grade 10 (2002) Magic Boxes</span>
<br/><br/>

"Box…it was another universe in there. Skills that I have acquired are mainly concerned with creativity. 
Brainstorming was good because it is actually what we do in life, not following orders like machines. Imagination 
was the best tool I had. My greatest success lies not in the art pieces I've made, but in the joy that I had 
in making them."<br/>
<span class="name">Sun Moon, Grade 12 (2002) Magic Boxes</span>
<br/><br/>

"I like the effect my box has on others and how they are surprised or try to look at it different ways and turn 
around with it. I like that every person sees something different in this box and sometimes something different 
from what they saw before."<br/>
<span class="name">Pan, Grade 11 (2003) World in a Box</span>
<br/><br/>

"The hardest challenge I consistently met was moving forward. Whether it was finding my idea for the structure or 
building it, every step needed concentration and appreciation. I am very happy and grateful for the massive amount 
of support and input I received from my friends in class. The project could never be what it is without them."<br/>
<span class="name">Ulysses, Grade 11 (2003) One's Self Box</span>
<br/><br/>

"In the beginning of the box project, I had no idea what it was going to look like or what it was going to be. 
As I was going through, I thought of the way things fall into place in one's life. This project made me think 
about the way a life is formed and the way individuals become unique."<br/>
<span class="name">Matan, Grade 10 (2003) One's Self Box</span>
<br/><br/>

"After doing this, I think I am more able to make strong decisions and to trust my instinct. Always keep trying. 
No matter how hopeless it seems, for everything there is a solution."<br/>
<span class="name">Bogdan, Grade 11 (2003) One's Self Box</span>
<br/><br/>

"I really enjoyed this project. I still remember when the idea flashed into my mind. I was really, really happy. 
Actually I enjoyed the whole thing. When I could see my box improving, I felt like I was raising a kid."<br/>
<span class="name">Jeong Seok, Grade 9 (2003) One's Self Box</span>
<br/><br/>

"It seemed as if the box itself was revealing the answers to my unending questions."<br/>
<span class="name">Yana, Grade 11 (2004) Form and Function Box</span>
<br/><br/>

"Even though I've been told this many times before, it was not until I experienced it first hand that it had direct 
impact. The process is often more important and more involved than the creation itself."<br/>
<span class="name">Olivia, Grade 11 (2004) Form and Function Box</span>
<br/><br/>

"It's a really interesting experience when you try to push your imagination away from stereotypical things and come 
up with something weird and creative. I learned that I develop my ideas better when I am stuck or bored. Yes, bored!"<br/>
<span class="name">Jun Kit, Grade 11 (2004) Form and Function Box</span>
<br/><br/>

"It was wonderful, the search of how to make people get inside another world. It made me think about how important it 
is to know at least a little bit about other people's cultures. It is important not only for self knowledge but also 
for comprehension between all people."<br/>
<span class="name">Jocelyne, Grade 11 (2005) Interactive Boxes</span>
<br/><br/>

"I kept thinking about mystery and secrets and how you put things away in boxes and when you open them up, its like 
going back to a memory."<br/>
<span class="name">Thalia, Grade 11 (2005) Interactive Boxes</span>
<br/><br/>

"I just made things and the box put itself together. A lot of unexpected things happened like, some things took a long 
time to make, things broke, things burned me. It made me think a lot and I found out that I really like making things. 
It makes me feel good."<br/>
<span class="name">Domagoj, Grade 9 (2005) Interactive Boxes</span>
<br/><br/>

"Now no longer are boxes square. Nothing is what it seems anymore."<br/>
<span class="name">Electra, Grade10 (2005) Interactive Boxes</span>
