In 1997 I was reading <u>The Poetics of Space</u> and was inspired as I followed Gaston Bachelard 
on his psychological tour of  the house.  He explored the meaning of entering attics and basements, 
of opening cupboards and cabinets.  He examined the significance of contained space. At some point 
I wrote "Idea - Boxes" on a scrap of paper.<br/> 
<br/>
The box is a powerful metaphor. A box holds promise, memory, and mystery. Opening a box is a discovery. 
It releases joy and surprise.<br/> 
<br/>
"What do you think of when you think of boxes?" I asked my international middle school art students in 
the fall of 1998.  Their answers to this and other questions resulted in an extraordinary experience. 
For the next ten weeks they collectively explored the poetic potential of contained space. Using a 
holistic process of investigation, the students created unique three-dimensional boxes.<br/> 
<br/>
The results were astonishing.<br/> 
<br/>
We started by brainstorming. Everyone shared ideas for what a box is or could be. As students borrowed 
and expanded on each other's concepts, their thinking evolved and their ideas became more enigmatic and 
intriguing.  The atmosphere began to buzz with curiosity and excitement.<br/> 
<br/>
We met once a day for a forty-five minute class period. Students shaped their ideas into rough draft 
test models and then into final 3D forms.  Making a box was harder than it seemed at first. Students 
had to fit sections together, construct mobile parts, and integrate sculptural forms. Their ideas 
determined the materials they used.<br/> 
<br/>
Students designed, drew, and painted. They cut cardboard, twisted wire, and sculpted wood and papier-mache. 
They carved wax, stitched cloth, and knotted string. They fashioned movable and spring activated devices 
like hinges, latches, and handles. They constructed doors and drawers. They worked with illusion, 
suspending forms in space. Their thinking was challenged and stretched.<br/> 
<br/>
They took risks, failed, and had to start all over again. At some point everyone got discouraged and 
wanted to quit. Advice and encouragement from others helped students evaluate, revise, and succeed. 
They learned to see mistakes as positive forces that can lead in new directions towards new discoveries. 
They learned to stay open to experience. They realized they were capable of wondrous things.  They became 
courageous and aware. They opened their eyes a little wider. They began to ask, "What else is possible?"<br/> 
<br/>
The finished boxes were marvelous and an impressive surprise. It was astounding that middle school 
students were capable of such sophisticated creative work. When students 
<a target="_top" href="page.html?go=Testimonials">reflected on their experience</a>, 
they were amazed that there were so many different ways to think about a box. They were impressed that making 
art required so much patience and hard work. And they were dazzled. The open-ended nature of the project gave 
students the freedom to experiment and explore. "It was like entering a new world," one student wrote, "a 
world of wonders, of things waiting to be discovered."<br/> 
<br/>
For the next seven years, my high school art students continued to make boxes. We approached a different 
initial question in a new way each year.<br/>
